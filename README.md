## FastAPI Project Setup Guide

Welcome to the FastAPI project! Follow these simple steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

## 1. Setting Up the Environment

To ensure everything runs smoothly, it's recommended to use a virtual environment:

1. Navigate to the main project directory:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/project
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   ```
3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On **Linux/macOS**:
     ```bash
     source env/bin/activate
     ```
   - On **Windows**:
     ```bash
     .\env\Scripts\activate
     ```

---

## 2. Install Requirements

With the virtual environment activated, install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 3. Run the Application

To start the project, simply run the following command:
```bash
python main.py &
```

- The `&` runs the application in the background, allowing you to continue using the terminal.

---

## 4. Manage Background Process

To manage the background process:
1. List all running jobs:

   ```bash
   jobs -l
   ```
2. Locate the job process ID associated with the running project.

3. Kill the background process:

   ```bash
   kill <jobprocess>
   ```
   Replace `<jobprocess>` with the specific process ID.


## 5. Access the Application

Once the application is running, open your web browser and navigate to:
